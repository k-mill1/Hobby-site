            <h3>Hatha</h3>
            <p>Hatha is traditionally about creating balance in the autonomic nervous system by following strengthening poses with poses that are relaxing and improve flexibility. Breath also plays an important part in the practice of Hatha Yoga. Together, breath and movement create balance in body and mind.<br>
            During a class, you can expect to hold each pose for between five and 10 breaths, with a strong focus on stability and building strength. Suitable for beginners and experienced practitioners alike, you'll build the foundations of breath and body awareness needed for all other styles.</p>
            <h3>Vinyasa</h3>
            <p>In its most literal sense, the word Vinyasa refers to "a flow". This can reference the flow between poses (downward dog to chaturanga to upward dog, for example) or, in a more general sense, a dynamic style of yoga where postures flow on from one another, with three to five breaths in each.<br>
            This class is good for those who need movement for meditation and is great for learning to use the breath as a tool. Generally, this is a good class for those who want to try yoga but would like an active, dynamic class.</p>  
            <h3>Ashtanga</h3>  
            <p>Ashtanga synchronises breath, postures and Drishti (meaning: gaze point) to create a dynamic, flowing practice that builds internal heat. The main difference is that the sequence is the same every time, no matter if you are practising Ashtanga in a class led by the teacher, or in a traditional self-practice setting where the teacher is there to silently guide you.</p>
            <h3>Yin</h3> 
            <p>Yin involves postures and stretches that deeply lengthen muscles and fascia (connective tissue) encasing joints and all muscles, thereby helping to improve joint mobility and overall flexibility. You would typically hold these poses between two and 10 minutes each, allowing ample time for deep-seated patterns of tension in the body to begin to release.<br>
            The slow pace of Yin yoga helps to calm the nervous system and provides students with an opportunity to slow down, rest and enjoy this more meditative style.</p> 
            <h3>Restorative</h3>
            <p>Another slower style of yoga, restorative yoga is perfect for calming down, chilling out and letting your body come to a place of rest.<br>
            Restorative yoga is a therapeutic style of yoga that uses props to support the body, encouraging deep relaxation. Using passive yoga asanas (poses), we let our nervous systems shift and relax. This helps us to relieve the effects of negative stress encountered in daily life and can be highly beneficial in times of fatigue, illness, and emotional strain.</p>  
            <h3>Kundalini</h3> 
            <p>Kundalini yoga combines invigorating movement, with dynamic breath work, meditation and the chanting of mantras to build vitality. During a class you’ll practise “kriyas”, such as strong repetitive arm movements, breathwork and hand gestures to help build mental endurance and fortify the nervous system.<br>
            Originally, the traditional Kundalini teachings focused on improving the flow of energy throughout the body: The traditional Kundalini Yoga is a powerful system of processes to stimulate neural networks across the body and brain. The chakras originate in the traditional teaching of Kundalini Yoga.</p>
            <h3>Power</h3>  
            <p>Power yoga is a broad term used to describe a dynamic practice, often incorporating arm balances and inversions, and sure to make you sweat. Power is almost always a vinyasa (flowing) style of class, with flowing movements to get your heart rate up and build strength.</p>
            <h3>Hot</h3>
            <p>Hot yoga is yoga practised in a hot environment. Any style of Yoga can be practised in a hot environment, but most hot yoga classes feature powerful postures, vinyasas and sequences. The thinking behind it is the heat enables the body to move more freely.<br>
            Naturally, you’ll sweat more in this type than others so keep hydrated and also have a towel for your feet which can slide on the mat.</p>
